            Thank you for considering me as your friend.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for being such a trust-worthy and reliable person.<br>
            Thank you for being such a wonderful friend. <br> 
            <br>
            This is a gift for you. I am not really good with gifts, but here it is: <br>
            A reminder of your hardwork. <br>
            <br>
            In a funny way, I hope. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            And last but not least: <br>
            <br>
